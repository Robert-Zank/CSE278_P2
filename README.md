## Description

The **CSE 278 Project 2** gives students practical experience in system-level operations and networking in C++. This project includes the implementation of socket programming, file handling, and client-server communication, helping students build a foundational understanding of network programming.

### Features:
- Implement networking concepts using C++.
- Perform client-server communication using sockets.
- Execute file handling and system-level operations.

## Installation

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Robert-Zank/CSE278_P2.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd CSE278_P2
    ```

3. Compile the C++ files:

    ```bash
    g++ -o project2 main.cpp
    ```

4. Run the project:

    ```bash
    ./project2
    ```

Ensure that you have a C++ compiler (such as `g++`) installed and that any necessary libraries or dependencies are properly set up.

## Usage

Once the project is compiled, you can execute the binary to run the program. Follow the on-screen prompts to engage in system-level and networking tasks such as client-server communication and file handling.

Hereâ€™s an example command to run the program:

```bash
./project2
